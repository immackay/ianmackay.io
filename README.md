# Resume Builder

- Run `pnpm i`/`npm i` to install dependencies
- Run `pnpm run dev`/`npm run dev` to launch the dev server with HMR
- Make modifications to `resume.config.ts`
- Fonts and main layout variables are in `Layout.tsx`
- You can modify the default component styling in  `components.module.css`
- You can add section specific styling in `sections.module.css`
- Ignore `index.css`, it just acts as a reset so that everything renders as expected
- The dark theme is just to ease your eyes while editing
- Print the page (`cmd-p` or `ctrl-p`) and save as PDF when you're done
- Can also be deployed as a static website if you so choose (change the favicon!)
